# NIRU Custom Dataset — 17 Nairobi Street Classes
# Fine-tunes YOLOv8n on Nairobi street footage extracted from H:/ video library.
#
# Raw source data (COCO-80 auto-labels):
#   annotation_frames/   — 1 JPG/second extracted from each video
#   annotation_labels/   — YOLO-format labels from YOLOv8n/COCO
#
# training/training.py remaps the 7 overlapping COCO classes to this schema
# and copies data into the prepared/ layout expected by YOLOv8 trainer.
#
# Prepare dataset:
#   python training/training.py --prepare-only
#
# Train (after prepare):
#   python training/training.py
#
# Or train directly with yolo CLI:
#   yolo detect train data=training/dataset.yaml model=yolov8n.pt epochs=50 imgsz=640

# Class names — Nairobi street context
# Classes 0-6 are remapped from COCO-80 auto-labels (see training.py COCO_TO_NAIROBI).
# Classes 7-16 require manual annotation or additional labeling passes.

# COCO-to-Nairobi remapping used by training.py during dataset preparation:
# (informational — parsed by training.py at runtime)
#
# COCO 0  (person)        → 6  (pedestrian)
# COCO 1  (bicycle)       → 5  (bicycle)
# COCO 2  (car)           → 2  (car)
# COCO 3  (motorcycle)    → 4  (motorcycle)   [bodaboda also tagged here initially]
# COCO 5  (bus)           → 0  (matatu)        [bus also tagged here initially]
# COCO 7  (truck)         → 3  (truck)
# COCO 9  (traffic light) → 11 (traffic_light)
# COCO 11 (stop sign)     → 12 (road_sign)
# All other COCO classes  → discarded
