# NIRU Custom Dataset — 20 Nairobi Street Classes
# Fine-tunes YOLOv8n on Nairobi street footage extracted from H:/ video library.
#
# Raw source data (COCO-80 auto-labels):
#   annotation_frames/   — 1 JPG/second extracted from each video
#   annotation_labels/   — YOLO-format labels from YOLOv8n/COCO
#
# training/training.py remaps the 5 overlapping COCO classes to this schema
# and copies data into the prepared/ layout expected by YOLOv8 trainer.
#
# Prepare dataset:
#   python training/training.py --prepare-only
#
# Train (after prepare):
#   python training/training.py
#
# Or train directly with yolo CLI:
#   yolo detect train data=training/dataset.yaml model=yolov8n.pt epochs=50 imgsz=640

# Class names — Nairobi street context
# Classes with COCO remapping are bootstrapped from auto-labels.
# Classes marked "manual" require annotation before the model can learn them.
names:
  0:  matatu              # 14-seat minibus PSV; remapped from COCO bus (catch-all)
  1:  nganya              # higher-capacity matatu variant — manual labels needed
  2:  city_hoppa          # large city bus brand — manual labels needed
  3:  school_bus          # yellow/marked school bus — manual labels needed
  4:  large_bus           # full-size inter-city bus — manual labels needed
  5:  bodaboda            # motorcycle taxi; remapped from COCO motorcycle (catch-all)
  6:  bodaboda_no_helmet  # helmetless rider safety flag — manual labels needed
  7:  bodaboda_stage      # motorcycle taxi waiting area — manual labels needed
  8:  tuk_tuk             # three-wheel auto-rickshaw — manual labels needed
  9:  mkokoteni           # human-powered push-cart — manual labels needed
  10: street_hawkers      # mobile street vendors — manual labels needed
  11: traffic_marshal     # yellow-vest traffic controller — manual labels needed
  12: conductor           # matatu tout / makanga — manual labels needed
  13: matatu_stage        # matatu bus stop / terminus — manual labels needed
  14: passenger           # pedestrian / commuter; remapped from COCO person (catch-all)
  15: illegal_dumping     # roadside waste dumping event — manual labels needed
  16: garbage_pile        # accumulated roadside garbage — manual labels needed
  17: traffic_lights      # traffic signal; remapped from COCO traffic light
  18: road_sign           # road / stop sign; remapped from COCO stop sign
  19: pothole             # road surface damage — manual labels needed

# COCO-to-Nairobi remapping used by training.py during dataset preparation:
# (informational — parsed by training.py at runtime)
#
# COCO 0  (person)        →  14 (passenger)     [hawkers, conductors, marshals need manual split]
# COCO 3  (motorcycle)    →   5 (bodaboda)       [tuk_tuk / no-helmet need manual split]
# COCO 5  (bus)           →   0 (matatu)         [nganya/city_hoppa/school_bus/large_bus need manual split]
# COCO 9  (traffic light) →  17 (traffic_lights)
# COCO 11 (stop sign)     →  18 (road_sign)
# COCO 1  (bicycle)       →  discarded (no equivalent class)
# COCO 2  (car)           →  discarded (no equivalent class)
# COCO 7  (truck)         →  discarded (no equivalent class)
# All other COCO classes  →  discarded
